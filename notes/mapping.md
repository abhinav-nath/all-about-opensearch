# Mapping

* Defines the structure of documents (e.g. fields and their data types)
  - Also used to configured how values are indexed

* Similar to a table's schema in a relational database

![Mapping](./images/mapping_1.png "Mapping")

There are 2 types of mapping:

1. **Explicit mapping**
   - We define the field mappings ourselves

2. **Dynamic mapping**
   - ES generates fields mappings for us
